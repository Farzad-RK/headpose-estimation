# Enhancing 6DRepNet with RepNeXt-M4 for Efficient Head Pose Estimation on Mobile Devices

## Abstract
We propose a novel enhancement to the 6DRepNet architecture by replacing its original RepVGG backbone with the recently introduced RepNeXt-M4, a state-of-the-art lightweight convolutional network optimized for mobile deployment. Our motivation stems from the need to balance inference latency, model compactness, and angular precision for real-time head pose estimation on edge devices. To our knowledge, this combination has not been previously explored or published. Preliminary analysis suggests that this substitution could offer improved accuracy, multi-scale feature extraction, and real-time compatibility, making it suitable for embedded and mobile vision applications.

## 1. Introduction
Head pose estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision, supporting applications in augmented reality, driver monitoring, and human-computer interaction. Modern approaches such as 6DRepNet demonstrate high performance by predicting continuous SO(3) rotations using 6D representations and geodesic loss. However, their mobile deployment is limited by the choice of backbone networks.

RepVGG, used in the original 6DRepNet, while efficient, does not leverage recent advances in multi-scale reparameterization and feature fusion. In this work, we introduce **RepNeXt-M4** as a replacement backbone and hypothesize that it improves both accuracy and efficiency.

## 2. Related Work
### 2.1. 6DRepNet
6DRepNet utilizes a 6D continuous representation of rotation matrices, followed by Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization and geodesic loss. It was designed for robust head pose estimation across wide angles and achieves state-of-the-art results using RepVGG or ResNet.

### 2.2. RepNeXt-M4
RepNeXt-M4 introduces a lightweight design optimized for mobile devices. It incorporates multi-scale parallel and serial convolution paths and fuses them using structural reparameterization. The result is high representational power with minimal inference latency (~1.5ms on iPhone 12).

### 2.3. Prior Integrations
No existing literature or implementations combine RepNeXt with 6DRepNet. This research aims to bridge that gap.

## 3. Methodology
### 3.1. Architecture Design
Our approach preserves the 6DRepNet regression head, Gram-Schmidt rotation mapping, and geodesic loss function, while replacing the backbone with RepNeXt-M4. The modified pipeline is as follows:

```

### 3.2. Loss Function
We retain the geodesic loss function:
\[
L_{geo}(\hat{R}, R_{gt}) = \arccos\left(\frac{\text{tr}(\hat{R}^T R_{gt}) - 1}{2}\right)
\]

### 3.3. Training Protocol

We follow the instructions from the original [6DRepNet](https://github.com/thohemp/6DRepNet/blob/master/README.MD) paper for data preparation and training. We place the datasets in a designated directory structure, such as `datasets/name_of_dataset`.

For preprocessing, we first need to create a `filenamelist` within the dataset directory for **300W-LP** and **AFLW2000**. To create this, we run the following command, adjusting the `--root_dir` as necessary for each dataset:

```bash
python create_filename_list.py --root_dir datasets/300W_LP
```

The **BIWI** dataset requires specific preprocessing steps. We must **preprocess the BIWI dataset using a face detector to cut out the faces from the images**. Scripts for this purpose, as well as for splitting the BIWI dataset into a **7:3 training/testing ratio**, are provided within the original 6DRepNet repository. Crucially, the **cropped image size for BIWI should be set to 256 pixels**.

Our training protocol itself will adhere to the following specifications:

*   **Dataset**: We will use **300W-LP for pretraining**, followed by **fine-tuning on the BIWI and AFLW2000 datasets**. These datasets are commonly used for training and validating head pose estimation models. We note that 300W-LP is for academic use only, and BIWI has a non-commercial license, which we use with caution for academic baseline comparisons.
*   **Optimizer**: We will employ **AdamW** as our optimizer.
*   **Scheduler**: A **Cosine decay** learning rate scheduler will be utilised.
*   **Augmentations**: To enhance the model's generalisation, standard augmentations such as **flip, color jitter, and Gaussian noise** will be applied during training.

## 4. Hypothesis
Replacing RepVGG with RepNeXt-M4 will:
- Improve angular accuracy due to enhanced multi-scale feature representation
- Maintain or reduce inference latency
- Improve robustness on real-world datasets (e.g. occlusion, expression variance)

## 5. Evaluation
We will benchmark our model against:
- Original 6DRepNet (RepVGG backbone)
- MobileNetV3 variant
- Newer baselines: MobileViG-Ti, EfficientFormerV2

Metrics:
- Mean Absolute Error (°) per angle (yaw, pitch, roll)
- Inference latency on mobile (iPhone 12, Pixel 6)
- Model size (parameters, MACs)

## 6. Preliminary Results (Planned)
We will present comparative evaluations using the same training pipeline and assess per-angle error, latency, and model size.

## 7. Contributions
- First integration of RepNeXt-M4 into 6DRepNet pipeline
- Establishes a new mobile-efficient SOTA for head pose estimation
- Demonstrates real-world feasibility with low-latency deployment

## 8. Conclusion and Future Work
This proposal outlines a new direction in efficient vision architecture design by combining state-of-the-art backbone (RepNeXt-M4) with a proven pose regression head (6DRepNet). If validated, this work can serve as a reference for future low-latency, high-precision applications in mobile vision.
