# Enhancing 6DRepNet with RepNeXt-M4 for Efficient Head Pose Estimation on Mobile Devices

## Abstract
We propose a novel enhancement to the [6DRepNet](https://github.com/thohemp/6DRepNet) architecture by replacing its original RepVGG backbone with the recently introduced [RepNeXt-M4](https://github.com/suous/RepNeXt), a state-of-the-art lightweight convolutional network optimized for mobile deployment. Our motivation stems from the need to balance inference latency, model compactness, and angular precision for real-time head pose estimation on edge devices. To our knowledge, this combination has not been previously explored or published. Preliminary analysis suggests that this substitution could offer improved accuracy, multi-scale feature extraction, and real-time compatibility, making it suitable for embedded and mobile vision applications.

## 1. Introduction
Head pose estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision, supporting applications in augmented reality, driver monitoring, and human-computer interaction. Modern approaches such as [6DRepNet](https://github.com/thohemp/6DRepNet) demonstrate high performance by predicting continuous SO(3) rotations using 6D representations and geodesic loss. However, their mobile deployment is limited by the choice of backbone networks.

[RepVGG](https://github.com/DingXiaoH/RepVGG), used in the original 6DRepNet, while efficient, does not leverage recent advances in multi-scale reparameterization and feature fusion. In this work, we introduce **RepNeXt-M4** as a replacement backbone and hypothesize that it improves both accuracy and efficiency.

### 2.1. 6DRepNet
6DRepNet utilizes a 6D continuous representation of rotation matrices, followed by Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization and geodesic loss. It was designed for robust head pose estimation across wide angles and achieves state-of-the-art results using RepVGG or ResNet.

- [Official codebase](https://github.com/thohemp/6DRepNet)

### 2.2. RepNeXt-M4
[RepNeXt-M4](https://github.com/suous/RepNeXt) introduces a lightweight design optimized for mobile devices. It incorporates multi-scale parallel and serial convolution paths and fuses them using structural reparameterization. The result is high representational power with minimal inference latency (~1.5ms on iPhone 12).

### 2.3. Prior Integrations
No existing literature or implementations combine RepNeXt with 6DRepNet. This research aims to bridge that gap.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1. Architecture Design

Our approach preserves the 6DRepNet regression head, Gram-Schmidt rotation mapping, and geodesic loss function, while replacing the backbone with RepNeXt-M4. The modified pipeline is as follows:

```text
[Input RGB Face Image] 224x224x3
        ↓
  [RepNeXt-M4 Backbone]
        ↓
  [Global Average Pooling]
        ↓
  [FC Layers → 6D Output]
        ↓
  [Gram-Schmidt Orthonormalization]
        ↓
  [SO(3) Rotation Matrix]
        ↓
  [Geodesic Loss (training) / Optional Euler Conversion (inference)]
````

### 3.2. Loss Function

We retain the geodesic loss function:

$$
L_{geo}(\hat{R}, R_{gt}) = \arccos\left(\frac{\text{tr}(\hat{R}^T R_{gt}) - 1}{2}\right)
$$

### 3.3. Training Protocol

* **Dataset preparation:**
  Follow instructions from the original [6DRepNet README](https://github.com/thohemp/6DRepNet/blob/master/README.MD).

  * Place datasets (300W-LP, AFLW2000, BIWI) in `datasets/<name>/`
* **Create filelists:**
  For each dataset, generate a `filenames.txt`:

  ```bash
  python create_filename_list.py --root_dir datasets/300W_LP
  ```
* **BIWI preprocessing:**
  Use the original 6DRepNet scripts for face cropping and split (see [official repo](https://github.com/thohemp/6DRepNet)).
* **Train/test splits:**

  * Pretrain on 300W-LP, fine-tune/evaluate on BIWI and AFLW2000.
  * 300W-LP is academic only; BIWI has a non-commercial license.
* **Training details:**

  * **Optimizer:** AdamW
  * **Scheduler:** Cosine decay
  * **Augmentations:** Flip, color jitter, Gaussian noise

  │     ├── repnext.py         # RepNeXt model implementations and registry
  │     └── repnext_utils.py   # Batchnorm fusion for deploy

```

* `model.py` now includes `SixDRepNet_RepNeXt`, wrapping RepNeXt with the 6D regression head.
* `train.py` allows selection of backbone and weights by command-line argument (`--backbone_type`, `--backbone_weights`).

### Model Instantiation

```python
from model import SixDRepNet_RepNeXt
from backbone.repnext import repnext_m4
model = SixDRepNet_RepNeXt(
    backbone_fn=repnext_m4,
    pretrained=True,
    deploy=False
)
```

You may select any RepNeXt variant (`repnext_m0` ... `repnext_m5`).

## 5. Hypothesis

Replacing RepVGG with RepNeXt-M4 will:

* Improve angular accuracy due to enhanced multi-scale feature representation
* Maintain or reduce inference latency
* Improve robustness on real-world datasets (occlusion, expression variance)
